## 📖 About ML4LLM_book

ML4LLM_book is a collection of code and materials that supports the book *"50 ML projects to understand LLMs"*. It offers practical projects designed to help you understand Large Language Models (LLMs) through hands-on machine learning examples. Whether you are new to machine learning or have some experience, this resource guides you step-by-step.

The projects cover a wide range of simple machine learning techniques and show how these relate to LLMs. You will find clear instructions and ready-to-use code snippets that you can run on your own computer.

**Step 2:** On the releases page, look for the latest stable version. You will see assets such as `.zip` or `.tar.gz` files containing the project's code and materials.

**Step 3:** Click the asset file to start the download. Save the file to a folder where you can find it easily, like your Desktop or Downloads folder.

**Step 4:** After downloading, extract the contents of the file:

- On Windows, right-click the file and choose **Extract All**.
- On Mac, double-click the file to unzip it.
- On Linux, use the terminal command `tar -xzf filename.tar.gz` or `unzip filename.zip`.

You now have the project files on your computer.

## 🚀 Running the Projects

Each project comes with a step-by-step guide in the form of a plain text or markdown file. These guides explain what to do and how the code works. Here is how to run a simple project:

1. Open the extracted folder.
2. Find the "README.md" or "Instructions.txt" file inside the project folder.
3. Follow the instructions carefully to set up your computer for running the code.

Most projects use Python, a common programming language for machine learning. To run the code, you need Python installed. If you do not already have Python, you can download it here:

- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once Python is installed, you can open a command prompt or terminal window:

- On Windows, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.
- On Mac, open **Terminal** from your Applications.
- On Linux, open your preferred terminal emulator.

Next, navigate to the folder of the project you want to run. For example:

```bash
cd Desktop/ML_project_folder
```

Then type the command given in the instructions to run that project. It usually looks like:

```bash
python project_script.py
```

## 🖥️ System Requirements

To use the ML4LLM_book materials and run the projects, your computer should meet these minimum requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 or later, or a recent Linux distribution.
- Processor: 64-bit Intel or AMD processor.
- RAM: 4 GB or more for smooth running, especially for larger projects.
- Disk Space: At least 500 MB free space for project files.
- Internet connection: Needed to download the files and, in some cases, to install required software packages.

## 🔧 Dependencies and Setup Tips

Some projects may require additional software or libraries. Most will guide you to install these automatically through simple commands. Common dependencies might include:

- **numpy**: for number and data manipulation.
- **pandas**: for handling data tables.
- **scikit-learn**: for machine learning models.
- **torch** or **tensorflow**: for deep learning frameworks.

To install these, you usually run commands in the terminal like:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

or

```bash
pip install torch
```

If you see a file called `requirements.txt` in the project folder, this file lists all needed libraries. You can install them all at once by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ How to Use the Projects

Each project is designed to teach a specific part of machine learning or LLMs. To make the best use of the materials:

1. Start with the simplest projects and follow the instructions fully.
2. Try running the example code as shown.
3. Experiment by changing small parts of the code to see what happens.
4. Use the provided explanations to understand each step.
5. Move to more advanced projects as you gain confidence.
