It is based on the 18th-century play Quatre Polichinelles semblables, or Four similar Pulcinellas, revolving around a stock character from commedia dell'arte. The work premiered at the Paris Opera on 15 May 1920 under the baton of Ernest Ansermet. The central dancer, Léonide Massine, created both the libretto and the choreography, while Pablo Picasso designed the costumes and sets. The ballet was commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, impresario of the Ballets Russes. A complete performance takes 35–40 minutes. Stravinsky revised the score in 1965.\"\n","\n","tokens =\n","\n","unique_tokens =\n","print"],"metadata":{"id":"n1HxyNZntsbY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# qualitative confirmation\n","print(tokenizer.\n","\n","# quantitative confirmation\n","print(f'\\nAre they the same? --> {}')"],"metadata":{"id":"-3h2KYL1KPlC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# loop through tokens and print out their lengths\n","token_lens ="],"metadata":{"id":"tDrLo_Vzt1lE"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# create a pandas dataframe\n","df = pd.DataFrame(\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"OSa9ljFgJkEC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["val_counts = df\n","val_counts"],"metadata":{"id":"PEUGw8MIJkAk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# specify figure size\n","plt.figure(figsize=(10,4))\n","\n","# draw the bar plot\n","sns.barplot(x=,y=,edgecolor='k',\n","            hue=val_counts.values,palette='plasma',legend=False)\n","\n","# adjustments\n","plt.gca().set(xlabel='Token length (characters)',ylabel='Count')\n","\n","plt.tight_layout()\n","plt.savefig('ch2_proj3_part1.png')\n","plt.show()"],"metadata":{"id":"Rg8w1nyMvmBI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"fmMz1q8qubD-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Part 2: Distributions of book token lengths**"],"metadata":{"id":"Y6LxEvjZr09E"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# all books have the same url format;\n","# they are unique by numerical code\n","baseurl = 'https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/'\n","\n","bookurls = [\n","    # code       title\n","    ['84',    'Frankenstein'    ],\n","    ['64317', 'GreatGatsby'     ],\n","    ['11',    'AliceWonderland' ],\n","    ['1513',  'RomeoJuliet'     ],\n","    ['76',    'HuckFinn'        ],\n","    ['219',   'HeartDarkness'   ],\n","    ['2591',  'GrimmsTales'     ],\n","    ['2148',  'EdgarAllenPoe'   ],\n","    ['36',    'WarOfTheWorlds'  ],\n","    ['829',   'GulliversTravels']\n","]"],"metadata":{"id":"O_mgzZqZua3p"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# initialize\n","plt.figure(figsize=(10,4))\n","\n","markersymbols = 'soh^vP*DXp'\n","\n","# loop over books\n","for i,(code,title) in enumerate(bookurls):\n","\n","  # get the text and tokenize\n","  tokens =\n","\n","  # count token lengths, create dataframe, and extract counts\n","  token_lens =\n","  df = pd.DataFrame(\n","  val_counts =\n","\n","  # create the scatter plot\n","  sns.scatterplot(x      =\n","                  y      =\n","                  s      = 80,\n","                  alpha  = .5,\n","                  marker = markersymbols[i],\n","                  edgecolor = 'k',)\n","\n","# some final adjustments\n","plt.gca().set(xlabel='Token length (characters)',ylabel='Frequency (norm.)',xscale='log')\n","\n","plt.tight_layout()\n","plt.savefig('ch2_proj3_part2.png')\n","plt.show()"],"metadata":{"id":"ulZiiaeT6qBl"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"k0qjQpvzQ4ZA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
